    <h1>FzMC Rules</h1>
    <p>The goal of our community is to provide a friendly, welcoming, constructive, and above all, safe place for discussing our Minecraft server. To work towards this goal, we have these rules and guidelines - please read them and follow them at all times.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Harassment is not tolerated in any capacity. This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>The use of derogatory slurs (whether sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise), or any targeted harassment/discrimation towards a particular person or minority group.</li>
          <li>Racism, Homophobia, Transphobia, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Evading moderation actions (such as voidings, mutes, tempbans) with alternative accounts or other loopholes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Griefing players' builds is not allowed. At first if you do get caught you will be temporarily jailed/banned, but if you continue, your access will be voided.
      </li>
      <li>
        Posting content that features nudity, heavy sexually suggestive themes, drug use, blood/gore, animal cruelty, and/or anything else that may be considered 18+ (‘NSFW’). This includes
        <ul>
          <li>
            Map Arts
          </li>
          <li>
            Images on our Discord Server
          </li>
          <li>
            ASCII arts
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Organizing raids is not allowed. The internet is not your personal army.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spam, including in DMs, any kind of unauthorised advertising, and off-topic discussions; please note that we expressly prohibit advertising invite links to other Discord guilds as we are unable to check them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arguing with staff about moderation actions, whether they apply to you or others.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must be 13+ to apply. We cannot moderate chat every second of the day and there are bound to be incidents.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key thing to take from this is to be respectful of others. Always <strong>THINK</strong> before you speak:
      <ul>
        <li>Is it <strong>T</strong>rue?</li>
        <li>Is it <strong>H</strong>elpful?</li>
        <li>Is it <strong>I</strong>nspiring?</li>
        <li>Is it <strong>N</strong>ecessary?</li>
        <li>Is it <strong>K</strong>ind?</li>
      </ul>
